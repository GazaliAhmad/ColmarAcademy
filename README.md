First Assessment for creating a website during my course.

And it was a terrible effort. I have never created a html file from scratch let alone using CSS. All the time I relied on automated tools. 

Looking back I just realised that doing one page is already so involved. 

Imaging scaling it up to 100 of pages.

As I progress into the course, there are tools to make things easier.
